# devops-git
A version-controlled DevOps project with Git

# Objective
Manage a DevOps project using Git best practices.

## Tools
- Git
- GitHub

## Steps Followed
1. Initialized local repository and pushed to GitHub.
2. Created branches:
   - `main` (stable release branch)
   - `dev` (development branch)
   - `feature-*` (feature branches for new work)
3. Worked on features inside `feature` branches.
4. Merged code using **Pull Requests** → `feature` → `dev` → `main`.
5. Added a `.gitignore` file to ignore logs and unnecessary files.
6. Tagged versions (e.g., `v1.0`) for releases.
7. Documented the process in **TASKS.md**.

## Repo Structure
devops-git/

    │── README.md
    │── TASKS.md
    │── .gitignore
    │── feature.py (sample feature)

## Outcome
- Learned Git branching workflow.
- Practiced PR-based collaboration.
- Used tags and markdown documentation.

## Summary
This task sets up a version-controlled DevOps project using Git and GitHub. It follows best practices by creating multiple branches (main, dev and feature), managing code changes through pull requests, tagging releases and documenting all steps using markdown. This workflow simulates a real-world collaborative development environment.

## Goal
The goal of this task is to understand and practice Git version control workflows—branching, merging with pull requests, using .gitignore, tagging versions and documenting the project—so that DevOps projects can be managed in a structured and professional way.
